                <p>Dear Mr Jacobs,</p>

                <p>
                    You are receiving this email because the employee listed below has been added to payroll and now requires system access. 
                    Please review their contact details in iTrent and provision the appropriate access accordingly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Employee Self Service (ESS) Access Please refer to CRM to determine the required ESS access level. There are three levels available:

                    Read Only (RO)

                    Lite Edit (LE)

                    Full Edit (FE)

                    The relevant user guidance for each access level is attached. Once the appropriate level has been identified, please provision access and share the corresponding guidance with the employee.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Line Manager Access If Line Manager Access has been requested, please note that this is only applicable if the school is operating under the Full Edit ESS access level. 
                    If the school is using either Read Only or Lite Edit ESS access, Line Manager Access should not be provisioned. Please confirm the school's ESS level via CRM.

                    Once verified, provision Line Manager Access if applicable and issue the attached Line Manager guidance.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Important Note Please be aware that some users may require both ESS and Line Manager Access. 
                    All employees should be granted ESS access, while Line Manager Access should be provided where appropriate.

                    If you have any questions or require further clarification, please contact Tom.
