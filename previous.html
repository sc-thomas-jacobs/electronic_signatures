<p>You have received this email because the below employee has been attached to payroll and requires system access. Please check the employee contact details entry in iTrent and provision the appropriate access:</p>

<p>For Employee Self Service Access, please use CRM to check which ESS access level is required (there are 3 levels: Read Only (RO); Lite Edit (LE); or Full Edit (FE) - attached is the relevant user guidance for all 3 access levels. Provision the access and send the user the appropriate guidance). </p>

<p>If Line Manager Access has been requested, please note that this is only relevent if the school is on Full Edit ESS access.</p>
<p>
<p>If the school is on 'read only' or 'Lite edit' you do not need to provision line manager access. Please use CRM to check this.</p>
<p>
<p>Once checked, provision the access if applicable and issue the attached line manager guide. ***Please also note that you may be setting up both ESS and line manager access for a user. All employees should have ESS and some employees will have Line manager access in addition to ESS. Any question please speak with Tom.</p>
